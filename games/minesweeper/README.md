# Mine Sweeper Game

## Game Rules
```
Mine Sweeper Game is very simple game.

1.
Click the desired tile on the game board.
This will display the number of mines around the selected tile (3x3).

1-2.
If there are no mines around the tile,
Opens adjacent tiles to tell you the number of mines in the vicinity.

2.
Right-click to raise the flag.
The flag means that there are mines in this space, so the goal is to find all the mines on the game board.

3. 
The game ends by clicking on a space with mines or opening all spaces other than mines.

* If you click the mouse left+right or click the mouse wheel at the same time, the area around the cell (3x3) is activated. This is called a chord.
** Right-click twice to display a question mark. This has no effect in the game and is simply a feature for the player. (If you right-click again, you can clear the mark.)
